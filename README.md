# chickenlittle
A java applet game.

This is an applet I made in 2011 using Java JApplet. In the game, an animated chicken tries to get from one side of the applet screen 
to the other, avoiding objects falling from the sky. The size and frequency of the objects changes as you level up. This is old code,
so looking for ways to make it more efficient/short/abstract.
